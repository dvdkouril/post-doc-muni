Spent this weeks mostly reading and learning about the Hi-C method and some other biological topics. 

I encountered [this lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tO--CnMDaI0&ab_channel=ManolisKellis) by prof. Manolis Kellis at MIT on chromatin 3D organization which led me to watching some introductory lectures from [the course's following year](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLypiXJdtIca6U5uQOCHjP9Op3gpa177fK). My idea was to try and see if I can follow what they're talking about. Since this lecture is about computer science a lot (duh, it's not called _computational_ biology for nothing) it took me back to my own CS studies. Feels nice to see it explained in this very useful context.

Matus has continued coding and we showed the application to our biology collaborator. From the first impression, it definitely looks like we finally have some basis from which we can continue in developing a tool that's both useful for biologists, and interesting from the data visualization viewpoint.

I'm currently trying to balance how much of the biology domain knowledge I need in order to come up with a suitable visualization technique. On one hand learning about biology can be very inspiring. It is however important not to get completely invested in learning a new field, just enough to be productive and competent in the current project.
