This is a semi-public online notebook containing notes from research during my post-doctural fellowship with VisitLab at Masaryk University.

In the past, I've filled several physical notebooks with ideas, notes, sketches, debugging information etc. I realized that I actually quite like browsing through these materials from the process. My idea now is to put these notes in a web form and in a way create in the public. There is always the risk of writing about something that doesn't end up being successful. But I still think that it can be valuable to keep myself accountable through this blog.

My goals and hopes:
- each Friday I put together a short report of things I worked on during the work week
- when the project is done, I can take a look at how it went, analyze where I got stuck when it maybe didn't count so much in the end
- it could help me in future projects to better estimate time costs
