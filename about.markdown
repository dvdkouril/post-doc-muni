Hi, my name is David and I'm a post-doc at Masaryk University (VisitLab) working in primarily biological data visualization. This site serves as a development log / research notebook during my post-doctoral fellowship. 

There are few goals in mind. My process in visualization research often involves a lot of sketching and writing for idea generation. In the past, I've filled many physical notebooks with ideas, notes, and sketches. I'm hoping to externalize some of those digitally to capture the process for my own reflection.
Secondly, I want to learn more of the modern technologies that I haven't used during my PhD. Namely I'll be focusing on learning modern Javascript, WebGPU, and in general explore creating in web environment as it became undeniably the way to go these days. 

As a side project, I'm interested in developing personal tools in the Apple ecosystem (learning Swift, SwiftUI) so there might be an update about this work from time to time as well.
